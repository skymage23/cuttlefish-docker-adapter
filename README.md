# cuttlefish-docker-adapter
This is a series of scripts and Dockerfiles intended to aid in the development of Android Open Source Project images and those of derivatives of said project.

It is not intended to be used independently and requires an AOSP checkout (or that of a derivative) and Docker.

The purpose of this project is to make usage of Cuttlefish easier on hosts that are not running Debian or one of its derivatives.
